# Terraria-Tile-Generator

Before you download the generator, make sure python 3 is installed, added to your %PATH% and %PYTHONPATH%, tkinter is installed and pip is installed.

Some dependencies must be installed before using this script, open up a terminal window and type in: 'pip3 install pillow numpy==1.15' (Without quotes).

For some strange reason the latest numpy does not allow the image array to be flagged as writeable and thus 1.15 must be used instead.

Original credits go to ghost20000, none of the code is mine and I am only uploading it since the repo link is dead. Some modifications had been made to the original code such as the ability to name the template.
